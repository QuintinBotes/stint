# Stint task T-0001: Rate-limit incoming webhooks per tenant

You are a coding agent working on one task in a git worktree that Stint created for it. Stint, not you, runs the tests and decides when the work is merged.

Rules for this run:
- Work only inside this worktree. Do not push, merge or rewrite git history; the person merges through Stint.
- When you make a design decision that should not be silently reversed, write it on its own line as: decision: <the decision>
- The test files this task and its plan name are locked. Changing one fails verification unless you record why on its own line as: decision: tests: <file> changed because <reason>. New tests, and new cases in other test files, are welcome.
- Say plainly what you did not finish and what you did not look at.
- After you stop, the daemon runs `bun run test` itself. A claim that the tests pass is not the record.

## Goal
POST /webhooks answers 429 with a Retry-After header when one tenant sends more webhooks than the configured limit in the configured window. Put the limiter in src/lib/limiter.ts, wire it into src/routes/webhooks.ts (and src/app.ts if it needs shared state), and read the limit and the window through loadConfig() in src/config.ts with defaults. Add tests in test/webhooks.test.ts or a new test file.

Acceptance:
- A tenant over the limit gets 429 with a Retry-After header
- Other tenants are not affected
- The limit and the window come from config, not constants in a route
- The suite stays green with new tests for the 429 path
